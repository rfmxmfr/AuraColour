# AuraColor App Rebuild Instructions

This document provides instructions for rebuilding the AuraColor app from scratch, following the roadmap in the project requirements.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clean Up the Codebase

Run the cleanup script to prepare for the rebuild:

```bash
./cleanup.sh
```

This will:
- Back up the current codebase
- Remove problematic files and directories
- Create a clean Docker setup
- Update package.json with fixed dependencies
- Create a clean run script

### 2. Set Up Project Structure

Run the project setup script to create the basic project structure:

```bash
./setup-project.sh
```

This will create:
- Core directories following Next.js App Router structure
- Essential configuration files
- Basic layout and home page

### 3. Set Up Database

The database schema is defined in `setup-database.sql`. You can apply it to your Supabase project using the Supabase CLI or the SQL Editor in the Supabase Dashboard.

### 4. Start Development

Run the development server:

```bash
./run-dev.sh
```
