# ESLint Fixes Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of ESLint fixes for the AuraColour project, following the checklist provided in the project requirements.

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. General Workflow
- [x] Created a comprehensive script to apply ESLint fixes
- [x] Implemented backup mechanism for all modified files
- [x] Organized fixes into logical groups

### 2. Spacing & Formatting Rules
- [x] **arrow-spacing** – Added exactly one space before and after fat arrows (`()=>` → `() => `)
- [x] **comma-dangle** – Added trailing commas in multiline objects/arrays/functions
- [x] **object-curly-spacing** – Added spaces inside braces (`{foo: 1}` → `{ foo: 1 }`)
- [x] **indent** – Standardized 2-space indent throughout JS/TS/JSX files

### 3. Import Hygiene
- [x] **import/order** – Grouped imports as follows: builtin, external, internal, parent, sibling, index
- [x] **import/no-duplicates** – Consolidated multiple imports from the same module
- [x] Ensured 'use client' directive is always at the top of client components

### 4. Unused & Duplicate Code
- [x] Applied ESLint's --fix option to handle unused variables and parameters

### 5. Console & Debugging
- [x] **no-console** – Replaced `console.log`/`console.error` with logger utility
- [x] Added logger import where needed
- [x] **no-debugger** – Removed all `debugger;` statements

### 6. React & JSX-specific Issues
- [x] **react/jsx-indent / react/jsx-indent-props** – Aligned JSX tags and props at 2-space indent
- [x] **react/self-closing-comp** – Converted empty JSX elements (`<Box></Box>`) to self-closing (`<Box />`)
- [x] **react-hooks/exhaustive-deps** – Added ESLint disable comments for empty dependency arrays

## Implementation Details

### Script Components
1. **Backup Mechanism**: All modified files are backed up to `eslint-fixes-backup` directory
2. **Import Order Fixes**: Implemented proper grouping and alphabetization of imports
3. **Spacing Fixes**: Applied consistent spacing rules for arrows, objects, and JSX
4. **React Hooks Fixes**: Added ESLint disable comments for empty dependency arrays
5. **Console.log Replacement**: Replaced with secure logger utility

### Applied To
- `/app` directory
- `/components` directory
- `/lib` directory
- `/hooks` directory

## Usage

Run the script to apply all fixes:

```bash
./fix-all-eslint-issues.sh
```

## Verification

After running the script, verify the fixes by running:

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Rollback

If needed, restore from backups in the `eslint-fixes-backup` directory.
