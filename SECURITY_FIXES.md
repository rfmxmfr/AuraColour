# Security Fixes: CWE-943 Vulnerability Remediation

## Overview

This document outlines the fixes implemented to address CWE-943 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic) vulnerabilities in the AuraColour application. These vulnerabilities could potentially allow SQL injection attacks if user-supplied input is directly used in database queries without proper sanitization.

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Input Validation and Sanitization

- Added Zod schema validation for all user inputs
- Implemented sanitizeHtml for text inputs to prevent XSS attacks
- Created a centralized security utility module (`lib/security.ts`)

### 2. API Routes Fixed

The following API routes were updated with proper input validation and sanitization:

- `/api/reports/route.ts`
- `/api/reports/[id]/route.ts`
- `/api/bookings/route.ts`
- `/api/12-season-analysis/route.ts`

### 3. Security Utilities Added

Created a new utility file (`lib/security.ts`) with the following functions:

- `sanitizeInput()`: Sanitizes HTML content to prevent XSS attacks
- `isValidUUID()`: Validates UUID strings
- `validationSchemas`: Common Zod validation schemas
- `safeJsonParse()`: Safely parses JSON with error handling
- `sanitizeObject()`: Recursively sanitizes an object's string properties

### 4. Dependencies Added

- Added `sanitize-html` package for HTML sanitization
- Using existing `zod` package for input validation

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated using Zod schemas before processing
2. **Parameterized Queries**: Using Supabase's parameterized query methods to prevent SQL injection
3. **Output Sanitization**: Sanitizing data before returning it to clients
4. **UUID Validation**: Validating UUID parameters before using them in database queries
5. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling to avoid exposing sensitive information

## Testing

To verify these fixes:

1. Run the application with the updated dependencies
2. Test each API endpoint with valid and invalid inputs
3. Verify that invalid inputs are properly rejected with appropriate error messages
4. Confirm that sanitization is working by submitting inputs with potentially harmful content

## Future Recommendations

1. Implement a comprehensive security testing suite
2. Add rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
3. Consider implementing Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
4. Regularly update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities
5. Conduct periodic security audits of the codebase
