# Code Fixes

This document outlines the high-level code issues that were fixed in the AuraColour application.

## 1. Duplicate API Endpoints

**Issue:** The application had two nearly identical API endpoints (`color-analysis` and `style-analysis`) that performed the same function with minor differences.

**Fix:** Created a unified `analysis` API endpoint that handles all service types, removing redundancy and ensuring consistent behavior.

## 2. Duplicate React Hooks

**Issue:** Multiple hooks (`useAIAnalysis`, `useStyleAnalysis`, `useColorAnalysis`) were doing the same thing with different endpoint targets.

**Fix:** Created a unified `useAnalysis` hook that all components can use, simplifying the codebase and making future updates easier.

## 3. Inconsistent Naming in Store

**Issue:** The store used `colorAnalysisAtom` for all service types, not just color analysis.

**Fix:** Renamed to `analysisResultAtom` for clarity and consistency with the unified approach.

## 4. AI References in User-Facing Code

**Issue:** AI references were present in user-facing code despite the business decision to remove them.

**Fix:** Systematically removed AI references from all user-facing components and renamed internal variables/fields for consistency.

## 5. Database Schema Inconsistencies

**Issue:** Database tables used inconsistent field names (`ai_analysis` vs `analysis_data`).

**Fix:** Updated the database schema to use consistent field names across all tables.

## 6. Error Handling and Loading States

**Issue:** Insufficient error handling and loading state management in the questionnaire flow.

**Fix:** Added proper error boundaries, loading indicators, and validation to improve user experience.

## 7. Form Validation

**Issue:** Limited client-side validation for form inputs.

**Fix:** Added comprehensive validation utilities and implemented them in the questionnaire flow.

## 8. Testing Infrastructure

**Issue:** Lack of automated tests for critical functionality.

**Fix:** Added basic test infrastructure and initial tests for validation logic.
